<strong class="abstract">Abstract</strong>. The first entry of this blog series
of implementing a Neural Network in C++ will be covering the
<strong>mathematical theory</strong> behind the fully connected layered
artificial neural networks. We will start by defining its
<a href="#sec:topology"
   title="Scroll to network topology section.">
  topology</a>
and its core <strong>components</strong>. Then we will dicuss how a neural
network works (namely
<a href="#sec:forward"
   title="Scroll to feed forward section.">
  forward propagation</a>)
This blog entry will finish by <strong>reformulating</strong> the learning
problem from a mathematical optimization point of view and deriving the
<em>well-known</em>
<a href="#sec:backward"
   title="Scroll to backward propagation section">
  backward propagation</a>
formula.
