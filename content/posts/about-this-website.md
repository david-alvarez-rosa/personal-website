After nearly a decade, I've rebuilt my personal site from scratch---a
blog on software, self-hosting, and lessons learned along the way.  This
first post is backdated to when I originally launched a site on this
domain, back in 2018.

**What?**---A personal blog.  Posts aim to be concise, practical, and
rigorous.

**Why?**---To give back to the _libre_ software community.  To keep a
record of my learning journey.  To deepen my own understanding by
writing things down.[^fn:1]

**Who?**---See the About page.

**Where?**---Self-hosted at my mother's house in northern Spain (ha!),
exposed to the Internet through a WireGuard tunnel to a VPS, and served
via a global CDN.

**When?**---Once or twice a month.

**How?**---Written in Emacs Org-mode, exported to Hugo with a custom
theme.[^fn:2]

If you spot an error or have suggestions, I welcome feedback---reach out
via the contact link on the About page.

[^fn:1]: As Einstein put it, _"If you can't explain it simply, you don't
    understand it well enough."_ Feynman followed the same principle,
    testing his understanding by teaching from first principles.
[^fn:2]: Inspired by the work of Edward Tufte and Matthew Butterick.
