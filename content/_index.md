Hello! This is David, a mathematician and software engineer interested
in low-latency systems, electronic trading, and high-performance
computing.  I'm a strong advocate of free (as in _freedom_) software and
devoted Emacs user.

On latency-sensitive paths, it's beneficial to manually replace dynamic
dispatch with _static polymorphism_, so calls are resolved at compile
time and the abstraction has effectively zero runtime cost.
