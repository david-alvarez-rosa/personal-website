&nbsp;[^fn:1]Hi! This is my personal site, where I share notes on software and
self-hosting.  You'll learn how things work behind the scenes, and how
to make them run fast, _very_ fast.

I'm a mathematician and engineer, a strong advocate of free (as in
_freedom_) software, and a devoted Emacs user.  I live in sunny Dublin.
