Hi! This is my personal site, where I share notes on software and
self-hosting.  You'll learn how things work behind the scenes, and how
to make them run fast, very fast.

I'm a mathematician and engineer, a strong advocate of
free{{< sidenote >}}As in _freedom_.{{< /sidenote >}} software, and a devoted Emacs
user.  I live in sunny Dublin.
