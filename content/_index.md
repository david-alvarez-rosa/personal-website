Hello! This is David, a software engineer.
Software engineer with experience in low-latency systems, electronic
trading, and HFT infrastructure. Currently at Susquehanna. Strong
advocate of free (as in freedom) software and devoted Emacs user.

Modern CPUs can execute billions of instructions per second, yet your
code can still be bottlenecked by something as mundane as how an array
is laid out in memory.
