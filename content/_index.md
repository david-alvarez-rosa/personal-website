&nbsp;[^fn:1]Hi! This is my personal site, where I share notes on software and
self-hosting.  You'll learn how things work under the hood, and how to
make them run fast, _very_ fast.

I'm a mathematician and engineer based in sunny Dublin, passionate about
low-latency, high-performance systems.  I'm a strong advocate of free
(as in _freedom_) software, and a devoted Emacs user.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/david-alvarez-rosa/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/david-alvarez-rosa), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/david-alvarez-rosa), [Medium](https://david-alvarez-rosa.medium.com/).
